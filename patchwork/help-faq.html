<h2 id="following">Following</h2>
<p><strong>What is following?</strong><br>
Following in Patchwork is like following in Twitter. It means you&#39;ll see the posts and actions of the person you follow.</p>
<p><strong>Can I talk to the people I follow?</strong><br>
Only if they follow you. If you want to converse with somebody, you&#39;ll both need to follow each other.</p>
<h2 id="pubs">Pubs</h2>
<p><strong>What are Pubs?</strong><br>
Pubs host users&#39; feeds and files on the public Internet.
Without a Pub, you won&#39;t be able to reach anybody outside of your WiFi, so you want at least one.</p>
<p><strong>How do I join a Pub?</strong><br>
Ask the Pub&#39;s operator for an invite-code. You can use the invite-code in Patchwork to join the Pub.</p>
<p><strong>Can I change Pubs?</strong><br>
Yes. You can change Pubs, and use more than one at once.</p>
<p><strong>Why do Pubs exist?</strong><br>
SecureScuttlebutt is a peer-to-peer network, but not all users can connect to each other because of inherent limitations of the Internet.
Pubs ensure that everybody can participate.</p>
<p><strong>How do I create my own Pub?</strong><br>
See <a href="../sbot/howto-setup-a-pub.md">HOWTO: Setup a Pub</a></p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p><strong>Who can read my public messages?</strong><br>
Anybody can, even if they&#39;re not following you when you make the post.</p>
<p><strong>Who can read my channel messages?</strong><br>
Anybody can. Channel messages are public.</p>
<p><strong>Who can see my profile, and who I follow?</strong><br>
Anybody can (currently). Profiles are public.</p>
<p><strong>Who can read my private messages?</strong><br>
Only the recipients. Private messages are encrypted end-to-end, so not even Pub operators can read them.</p>
<p><strong>Who can see which messages I open, or what I search for?</strong><br>
Nobody. Patchwork runs on your device, so nobody can track your clicks around the application.</p>
